## Infinite Scroll?

Every one expect the content to just appear when we are sliding down on the app, but for this challenge i let 2 paginations type, the normal boring paginated with numbers way, and the almost infinite scroller ...

*Why almost?*

Well i dont load on background the content just before you get to the 90% down the screen, i just load when you reach the bottom. *WHY?* well i wanted to show that u can ALSO use the pagination on the bottom of the page, just to make you REALIZE in what related page are you when you wanted to slide down. MAYBE is poor design choice, but right now i do care for the challenge.
